        <p>
        I have a masterâ€™s degree in computational engineering and my passion is coding and developing Web Applications.
        I have worked as trainee software developer at Softrain Blobs Oy where I rewrote a big part of their transportation
        software with modern web technologies including React and Nodejs. <br /><br />
        I am looking for an internship or an entry level role to work and improve my skills.
